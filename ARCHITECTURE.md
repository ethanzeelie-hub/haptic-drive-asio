# Architecture

Haptic Drive ASIO is organized around clear boundaries between telemetry input, shared vehicle state, haptic effects, audio output, recording, and UI.

## Initial Project Boundaries

- `HapticDrive.Asio.App`: WPF app shell and presentation layer.
- `HapticDrive.Asio.Core`: shared models, interfaces, effect contracts, and domain rules.
- `HapticDrive.Asio.Telemetry.F1_25`: official F1 25 UDP packet parsing and mapping into shared state.
- `HapticDrive.Asio.Audio`: output device abstractions, mixer, safety processors, and debug output paths.
- `HapticDrive.Asio.Recording`: raw packet recording and deterministic replay.

## Target Flow

```text
F1 25 UDP packets
-> game-specific parser
-> game-specific adapter
-> shared VehicleState
-> haptic effect engine
-> mixer and safety chain
-> audio output device
```

## Early Development Rule

The app must build and test without ASIO hardware, M-Audio hardware, the Fosi amplifier, the Dayton BST-1, F1 25, or any live telemetry stream.

## Stage 01 App Shell

The WPF app shell provides navigation placeholders for Dashboard, Effects, Mixer / Routing, Devices, Telemetry / UDP Router, Recordings, Test Bench, Profiles, Settings, and Diagnostics.

Global haptics start/stop, emergency mute, theme selection, and close/minimize-to-tray setting placeholders exist in the shell. They are intentionally not connected to telemetry or audio behavior yet.

## Stage 02 Output Abstractions

Core owns the shared `IAudioOutputDevice` contract and related status/configuration records.

Audio owns concrete output device implementations:

- `NullAudioOutputDevice`: deterministic, hardware-free default for tests and startup.
- `WasapiDebugOutputDevice`: manual debug placeholder only.
- `AsioAudioOutputDevice`: ASIO abstraction/stub with graceful unavailable-driver handling.

ASIO driver discovery is isolated behind `IAsioDriverCatalog` so automated tests can use a fake catalog and later stages can add real driver enumeration without changing the output contract.
